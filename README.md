# STIG Manager

STIG Manager is an open source project maintained by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT). It provides software for managing the assessment of information systems against security checklists published by the US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). STIG Manager supports DISA checklists published as either a Security Technical Implmentation Guide (STIG) or a Security Requirement Guide (SRG).

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It explains:

- The timeline for project milestones

If you want to run STIG Manager in a production or real-world scenario, we recommend you visit the classic branch (please see below).   Future contributions will work towards a master brach for a stable production releases at version (3.0.0). We'll celebrate that milestone by updating this README as soon as it happens!

#### [Classic branch](../classic)

The STIG Manager project began in 2012 as closed source software to support NUWCDIVNPT workflows and processes. 

We have modified the final version of the original software (version 2.0) so it can execute in a Docker enviorment and have committed it to the [Classic branch](../classic) in this repository. STIG Manager Classic is provided "as-is" and we recommend using it in development environments only as a reference for modernizing the project.
