# STIG Manager

STIG Manager is software for managing the assessment of Information Systems for compliance with security checklists published by the United States (US) Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). STIG Manager supports DISA checklists published as a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) or a Security Requirements Guide (SRG).

This open source project is maintained by the US Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT). Our initial goal is to "modernize" the original software to provide STIG Management features through a REST API.  

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It explains:
- How you can get involved in the project and contribute
- How to set up a development environment to work with the project's code 

## Status

This repository is under construction as we begin the project. We are editing the initial documentation and preparing the existing codebase for public release. We will also be committing our initial "modernized" API to the repository in another few days.

If you want to test out STIG Manager right away, SOON you can switch to the [Classic branch](https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/tree/classic) and read how to do that. Please note: The Classic codebase uses technologies we have abandoned. It is provided as a reference implementation until this project's API achieves parity with it.

All new contributions to the project will be directed towards a stable production release of version 3.0.0 in accordance with our [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Roadmap

We will have a [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) document. It will include:
- The project's history and objectives
- A feature summary
- The timeline for project milestones
