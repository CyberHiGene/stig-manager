# STIG Manager Classic

This branch provides STIG Manager Classic for Docker and is made available so you can become familiar with the STIG Manager interface and features. We hope you will agree the software is useful and this encourages you to contribute to our Project.

**THE CLASSIC VERSION IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE IN ANY FORM.** 

The technologies used by the Classic version have been abandoned and the Project's intent is to use this version for reference while modernizing the API and refactoring the UI.
