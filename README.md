# STIG Manager Classic

This branch provides STIG Manager Classic for Docker so you can become familiar with the STIG Manager interface and features. We hope you will agree the software is useful and this encourages you to contribute to our Project.

**THE CLASSIC VERSION IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.** 

The technologies used by the Classic version are deprecated. The Project's intent is to use this full featured version for reference while modernizing the API and refactoring the UI.
