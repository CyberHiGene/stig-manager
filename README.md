# STIG Manager

STIG Manager is an open source project maintained by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT). It provides software for managing the assessment of information systems against security checklists published by the US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). STIG Manager supports DISA checklists published as either a Security Technical Implmentation Guide (STIG) or a Security Requirements Guide (SRG).

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It explains:
- How you can get involved in the project and contribute
- How to set up a development environment to work with the project's code 

## Status

This repository is under construction as we begin the project. We are editing the initial documentation and preparing the Classic codebase (see below) for release. We will also be committing the initial Modern API code to the repository in another several days.

If you want to test out STIG Manager right away, you can switch to the [Classic branch](https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/tree/classic) and read how to do that. Please note, however, that the Classic codebase uses technologies we have abandoned. It will remain useful as a reference until we finish modernizing the API.

All new contributions to the project will be directed towards a stable production release of version 3.0.0 in accordance with our [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Roadmap

We will have a [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) document. It will include:
- The project's history and objectives
- A feature summary
- The timeline for project milestones
