Testing notes:
- Requires STIGMan testing realm in Keycloak.
- Recommend 7 iterations in collection runner, with current set of test data.
- Test data should be loaded through the STIGMan GUI or the Postman GUI with the request in the LoadTestData folder. Postman does not easily let you send a file as part of a request in Collection Runner (Should work fine in Newman, though.)
